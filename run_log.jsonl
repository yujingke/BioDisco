Since their introduction, over 20 years ago, targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for NSCLC. Nowadays, targeted therapies remain the gold standard for many patients, but still they suffer from many adverse effects, including unexpected toxicity and intrinsic acquired resistance mutations, which lead to relapse. The adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 2015, has offered exceptional survival benefits for patients without targetable alterations. Despite this notable progress, challenges remain, as not all patients respond favorably to ICIs, and resistance to therapy can develop over time. A crucial factor influencing clinical response to immunotherapy is the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is pivotal in orchestrating the interactions between neoplastic cells and the immune system, influencing tumor growth and treatment outcomes. In this review, we discuss how the understanding of this intricate relationship is crucial for the success of immunotherapy and survey the current state of immunotherapy intervention, with a focus on forthcoming and promising chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies in NSCLC. The TME sets major obstacles for CAR-T therapies, creating conditions that suppress the immune response, inducing T cell exhaustion. To enhance treatment efficacy, specific efforts associated with CAR-T cell therapy in NSCLC, should definitely focus TME-related immunosuppression and antigen escape mechanisms, by combining CAR-T cells with immune checkpoint blockades.\", \"pub_date\": \"2025\", \"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39995659/\"}", "{\"id\": \"40013761\", \"title\": \"CK2B Induces CD8\", \"abstract\": \"Anti-PD-1 therapy has left an indelible mark in the field of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment; however, its efficacy is limited in clinical practice owing to differences in the degree of effector T-cell exhaustion.

Recent advances in molecular profiling, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have revolutionized NSCLC management, ushering in an era of personalized treatment with improved patient outcomes. The increased adoption of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening has enhanced early detection, enabling intervention at more curable stages. Molecular diagnostics now play a pivotal role in guiding treatment strategies, with actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) informing the use of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, NRG1, and other targeted inhibitors in both early and advanced settings. For instance, targeted therapies are increasingly being integrated into early-stage management, with adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR-mutated NSCLC and alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrating substantial survival benefits. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become a cornerstone of treatment for AGA-negative NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, and is increasingly being utilized in the perioperative setting. Furthermore, emerging therapies such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and novel immunotherapeutic agents show promise in addressing resistance mechanisms and improving outcomes in advanced-stage disease.

By promoting multivalent galectin-glycoprotein lattice formation at the cell surface, branching regulates clustering and/or endocytosis of the TCR complex (TCR+CD4/CD8), CD45, CD25, BCR, TLR2 and TLR4 to inhibit T cell and B cell activation/proliferation and proinflammatory TH1 and TH17 over TH2 and induced T regulatory cell responses. In addition, branching promotes cell surface retention of the growth inhibitory receptor CTLA-4. However, the role of N-glycan branching in regulating cell surface levels of other checkpoint receptors such as BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) is unknown. In this study, we report that whereas branching significantly enhances PD-1 cell surface expression by reducing loss from endocytosis, the opposite occurs with BTLA in both T cells and B cells. T cell hyperactivity induced by branching deficiency was opposed by BTLA ligation proportional to increased BTLA expression. Other members of the BTLA/HVEM (herpesvirus entry mediator) signaling axis in T cells, including HVEM, LIGHT, and CD160, are largely unaltered by branching. Thus, branching-mediated endocytosis of BTLA is opposite of branching-induced inhibition of PD-1 endocytosis. In this manner, branching deficiency-induced upregulation of BTLA appears to serve as a checkpoint to limit extreme T cell hyperactivity and proinflammatory outcomes in T cells with low branching.\nPMID: 38281324\nTitle: Blockade of BTLA alone or in combination with PD-1 restores the activation and proliferation of CD8\nAbstract: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection can result in typical peripheral blood lymphopenia and immune dysfunction.

Genomic sequencing has detected that the unique mutational profile of both the somatic and germline modifications in TNBC is staggeringly dissimilar from other breast tumor subtypes. The clinical utility of sequencing germline BRCA1/2 genes has been well established in TNBC. Nevertheless, reports regarding the penetrance and risk of other susceptibility genes are relatively scarce. Recurring mutations (e.g., TP53 and PI3KCA mutations) occur together with rare mutations in TNBC, and the shared effects of genomic modifications drive its progression. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of this disease, a clinical understanding of the genomic modifications in TNBC can pave an innovative way toward its therapy.

However, genomic alterations in other DNA damage response genes have not been consistently predictive of clinical response to PARP inhibition. Here, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in BRCA1/2-proficient prostate cancer cells and identify previously unknown genes whose loss has a profound impact on PARP inhibitor response. Specifically, MMS22L deletion, frequently observed (up to 14%) in prostate cancer, renders cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors by disrupting RAD51 loading required for homologous recombination repair, although this response is TP53-dependent. Unexpectedly, loss of CHEK2 confers resistance rather than sensitivity to PARP inhibition through increased expression of BRCA2, a target of CHEK2-TP53-E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression. Combined PARP and ATR inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance caused by CHEK2 loss. Our findings may inform the use of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA1/2-deficient tumors and support reevaluation of current biomarkers for PARP inhibition in prostate cancer.\nPMID: 35264596\nTitle: Detection of germline variants in Brazilian breast cancer patients using multigene panel testing.\nAbstract: Genetic diversity of germline variants in breast cancer (BC) predisposition genes is unexplored in miscegenated populations, such those living in Latin America. We evaluated 1663 Brazilian BC patients, who underwent hereditary multigene panel testing (20-38 cancer susceptibility genes), to determine the spectrum and prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Associations between P/LP variants and BC risk were estimated in a case-control analysis of BC patients and 18,919 Brazilian reference controls (RC). In total, 335 (20.1%) participants carried germline P/LP variants: 167 (10.0%) in BRCA1/2, 122 (7.3%) in BC actionable non-BRCA genes and 47 (2.8%) in candidate genes or other cancer predisposition genes. Overall, 354 distinctive P/LP variants were identified in 23 genes. The most commonly mutated genes were: BRCA1 (27.4%), BRCA2 (20.3%), TP53 (10.5%), monoallelic MUTYH (9.9%), ATM (8.8%), CHEK2 (6.2%) and PALB2 (5.1%). The Brazilian variant TP53 R337H (c.1010G>A, p.Arg337His), detected in 1.6% of BC patients and 0.1% of RC, was strongly associated with risk of BC, OR = 17.4 (95% CI: 9.4-32.1; p < 0.0001); monoallelic MUTYH variants c.1187G>A and c.536A>G, detected in 1.2% (0.9% RC) and 0.8% (0.4% RC) of the patients, respectively, were not associated with the odds of BC, the former with OR = 1.4 (95% CI: 0.8-2.4; p = 0.29) and the latter with OR = 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9-3.9; p = 0.09). The overall VUS rate was 46.1% for the entire patient population.

However, genomic alterations in other DNA damage response genes have not been consistently predictive of clinical response to PARP inhibition. Here, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in BRCA1/2-proficient prostate cancer cells and identify previously unknown genes whose loss has a profound impact on PARP inhibitor response. Specifically, MMS22L deletion, frequently observed (up to 14%) in prostate cancer, renders cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors by disrupting RAD51 loading required for homologous recombination repair, although this response is TP53-dependent. Unexpectedly, loss of CHEK2 confers resistance rather than sensitivity to PARP inhibition through increased expression of BRCA2, a target of CHEK2-TP53-E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression. Combined PARP and ATR inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance caused by CHEK2 loss. Our findings may inform the use of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA1/2-deficient tumors and support reevaluation of current biomarkers for PARP inhibition in prostate cancer.\nPMID: 35264596\nTitle: Detection of germline variants in Brazilian breast cancer patients using multigene panel testing.\nAbstract: Genetic diversity of germline variants in breast cancer (BC) predisposition genes is unexplored in miscegenated populations, such those living in Latin America. We evaluated 1663 Brazilian BC patients, who underwent hereditary multigene panel testing (20-38 cancer susceptibility genes), to determine the spectrum and prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Associations between P/LP variants and BC risk were estimated in a case-control analysis of BC patients and 18,919 Brazilian reference controls (RC). In total, 335 (20.1%) participants carried germline P/LP variants: 167 (10.0%) in BRCA1/2, 122 (7.3%) in BC actionable non-BRCA genes and 47 (2.8%) in candidate genes or other cancer predisposition genes. Overall, 354 distinctive P/LP variants were identified in 23 genes. The most commonly mutated genes were: BRCA1 (27.4%), BRCA2 (20.3%), TP53 (10.5%), monoallelic MUTYH (9.9%), ATM (8.8%), CHEK2 (6.2%) and PALB2 (5.1%). The Brazilian variant TP53 R337H (c.1010G>A, p.Arg337His), detected in 1.6% of BC patients and 0.1% of RC, was strongly associated with risk of BC, OR = 17.4 (95% CI: 9.4-32.1; p < 0.0001); monoallelic MUTYH variants c.1187G>A and c.536A>G, detected in 1.2% (0.9% RC) and 0.8% (0.4% RC) of the patients, respectively, were not associated with the odds of BC, the former with OR = 1.4 (95% CI: 0.8-2.4; p = 0.29) and the latter with OR = 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9-3.9; p = 0.09).

In the germline BRCA1/2-mutated group, median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% CI 2·3-9·2) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 6·4 months (4·3-8·2) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·38-1·67]; log-rank p=0·54). In the BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·3-7·8) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 4·2 months (2·3-5·0) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·37-0·88]; p=0·010). In the non-BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 4·0 months (95% CI 2·5-4·7) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 3·0 months (2·2-4·4) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·60-1·33]; p=0·57). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events attributed to treatment were neutropenia (71 [46%] of 155 patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group vs 29 [20%] of 147 in the cisplatin plus placebo group), leukopenia (42 [27%] vs 11 [7%]), anaemia (35 [23%] vs 12 [8%]), and thrombocytopenia (29 [19%] vs four [3%]). Serious adverse events attributed to treatment occurred in 48 (31%) patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 53 (36%) patients in the cisplatin plus placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in one patient in the cisplatin plus veliparib group (sepsis) and one patient in the cisplatin plus placebo group (acute kidney injury due to cisplatin plus heart failure from previous doxorubicin exposure). The addition of veliparib to cisplatin significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with BRCA-like metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but not in patients with non-BRCA-like metastatic breast cancer.

These NCCN Guidelines Insights summarize important updates regarding: (1) a new section for transgender, nonbinary and gender diverse people who have a hereditary predisposition to cancer focused on risk reduction strategies for ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer; and (2) testing criteria and management associated with TP53 P/LP variants and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\nPMID: 36650183\nTitle: CRISPR screens reveal genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in prostate cancer.\nAbstract: Prostate cancer harboring BRCA1/2 mutations are often exceptionally sensitive to PARP inhibitors. However, genomic alterations in other DNA damage response genes have not been consistently predictive of clinical response to PARP inhibition. Here, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in BRCA1/2-proficient prostate cancer cells and identify previously unknown genes whose loss has a profound impact on PARP inhibitor response. Specifically, MMS22L deletion, frequently observed (up to 14%) in prostate cancer, renders cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors by disrupting RAD51 loading required for homologous recombination repair, although this response is TP53-dependent. Unexpectedly, loss of CHEK2 confers resistance rather than sensitivity to PARP inhibition through increased expression of BRCA2, a target of CHEK2-TP53-E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression. Combined PARP and ATR inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance caused by CHEK2 loss. Our findings may inform the use of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA1/2-deficient tumors and support reevaluation of current biomarkers for PARP inhibition in prostate cancer.\nPMID: 35264596\nTitle: Detection of germline variants in Brazilian breast cancer patients using multigene panel testing.\nAbstract: Genetic diversity of germline variants in breast cancer (BC) predisposition genes is unexplored in miscegenated populations, such those living in Latin America. We evaluated 1663 Brazilian BC patients, who underwent hereditary multigene panel testing (20-38 cancer susceptibility genes), to determine the spectrum and prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Associations between P/LP variants and BC risk were estimated in a case-control analysis of BC patients and 18,919 Brazilian reference controls (RC). In total, 335 (20.1%) participants carried germline P/LP variants: 167 (10.0%) in BRCA1/2, 122 (7.3%) in BC actionable non-BRCA genes and 47 (2.8%) in candidate genes or other cancer predisposition genes. Overall, 354 distinctive P/LP variants were identified in 23 genes. The most commonly mutated genes were: BRCA1 (27.4%), BRCA2 (20.3%), TP53 (10.5%), monoallelic MUTYH (9.9%), ATM (8.8%), CHEK2 (6.2%) and PALB2 (5.1%). The Brazilian variant TP53 R337H (c.1010G>A, p.Arg337His), detected in 1.6% of BC patients and 0.1% of RC, was strongly associated with risk of BC, OR = 17.4 (95% CI: 9.4-32.1; p < 0.0001); monoallelic MUTYH variants c.1187G>A and c.536A>G, detected in 1.2% (0.9% RC) and 0.8% (0.4% RC) of the patients, respectively, were not associated with the odds of BC, the former with OR = 1.4 (95% CI: 0.8-2.4; p = 0.29) and the latter with OR = 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9-3.9; p = 0.09). The overall VUS rate was 46.1% for the entire patient population. Concluding, the use of multigene panel testing almost doubled the identification of germline P/LP variants in clinically actionable predisposition genes in BC patients. In Brazil, special attention should be given to TP53 P/LP variants.\nPMID: 38151625\nTitle: Small-molecule inhibition of kinesin KIF18A reveals a mitotic vulnerability enriched in chromosomally unstable cancers.\nAbstract: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, caused by persistent errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Aggressive cancers like high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a high frequency of CIN and TP53 mutations. Here, we show that inhibitors of the KIF18A motor protein activate the mitotic checkpoint and selectively kill chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Sensitivity to KIF18A inhibition is enriched in TP53-mutant HGSOC and TNBC cell lines with CIN features, including in a subset of CCNE1-amplified, CDK4-CDK6-inhibitor-resistant and BRCA1-altered cell line models. Our KIF18A inhibitors have minimal detrimental effects on human bone marrow cells in culture, distinct from other anti-mitotic agents. In mice, inhibition of KIF18A leads to robust anti-cancer effects with tumor regression observed in human HGSOC and TNBC models at well-tolerated doses. Collectively, our results provide a rational therapeutic strategy for selective targeting of CIN cancers via KIF18A inhibition.\nPMID: 40040635\nTitle: Integrated Profiling Delineated KIF18A as a Significant Biomarker Associated with Both Prognostic Outcomes and Immune Response in Pancreatic Cancer.\nAbstract: Kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A) is a member of the kinesin-8 family of motor proteins, involved in the progression and metastasis of various tumors. However, its role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remains unclear. To evaluate that role, RNA sequencing datasets, complemented by pertinent clinical metadata, were procured from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repositories. The protein expression level of KIF18A in PAAD was derived from human protein atlas (HPA) database. The differences in KIF18A expression levels and prognostic related genes were identified through multivariate Cox regression and Lasso regression analysis to construct a prognostic risk model. The Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB), Microsatellite (MSI), immune landscape, mutation landscape and drug sensitivity of high- and low-expression KIF18A groups were assessed in immunotherapy cohorts and KIF18A expression cohorts. Finally, in vitro experiments were conducted to elucidate the molecular function of KIF18A in regulating the malignant behavior of PAAD. KIF18A is highly expressed in PAAD and is closely related to worse clinical stage and poor prognosis. Single cell analysis revealed that KIF18A is mainly expressed in microtubules of tumor cells and participated in mitosis and cell cycle of PAAD. Further analysis revealed that the expression of KIF18A is closely related to TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. In vitro experiments confirmed that KIF18A promotes the proliferation, migration and expression of adhesion molecules in PAAD, and inhibits angiogenesis. In addition, the high expression of KIF18A is positively related to ferroptosis and m6A genes expression, and its high expression is driven by mutated KRAS and TP53. This study confirmed that KIF18A can be used as a marker to predict the prognosis and immunotherapy of PAAD, and it participates in the formation of microtubules in PAAD cells and promotes the malignant behavior of PAAD.\nPMID: 37759912\nTitle: The Comprehensive Analysis of m6A-Associated Anoikis Genes in Low-Grade Gliomas.\nAbstract: The relationship between N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators and anoikis and their effects on low-grade glioma (LGG) is not clear yet.
