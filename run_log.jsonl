We highlight the biological basis of CD8 T cell exhaustion in shaping the antitumor immune response. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting additional inhibitory receptors (IR) are discussed, with a focus on their distinct mechanisms of action and combinatory potential with existing therapies.

Since their introduction, over 20 years ago, targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for NSCLC. Nowadays, targeted therapies remain the gold standard for many patients, but still they suffer from many adverse effects, including unexpected toxicity and intrinsic acquired resistance mutations, which lead to relapse. The adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 2015, has offered exceptional survival benefits for patients without targetable alterations. Despite this notable progress, challenges remain, as not all patients respond favorably to ICIs, and resistance to therapy can develop over time. A crucial factor influencing clinical response to immunotherapy is the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is pivotal in orchestrating the interactions between neoplastic cells and the immune system, influencing tumor growth and treatment outcomes. In this review, we discuss how the understanding of this intricate relationship is crucial for the success of immunotherapy and survey the current state of immunotherapy intervention, with a focus on forthcoming and promising chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies in NSCLC. The TME sets major obstacles for CAR-T therapies, creating conditions that suppress the immune response, inducing T cell exhaustion. To enhance treatment efficacy, specific efforts associated with CAR-T cell therapy in NSCLC, should definitely focus TME-related immunosuppression and antigen escape mechanisms, by combining CAR-T cells with immune checkpoint blockades.\", \"pub_date\": \"2025\", \"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39995659/\"}", "{\"id\": \"40013761\", \"title\": \"CK2B Induces CD8\", \"abstract\": \"Anti-PD-1 therapy has left an indelible mark in the field of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment; however, its efficacy is limited in clinical practice owing to differences in the degree of effector T-cell exhaustion.

Recent advances in molecular profiling, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have revolutionized NSCLC management, ushering in an era of personalized treatment with improved patient outcomes. The increased adoption of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening has enhanced early detection, enabling intervention at more curable stages. Molecular diagnostics now play a pivotal role in guiding treatment strategies, with actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) informing the use of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, NRG1, and other targeted inhibitors in both early and advanced settings. For instance, targeted therapies are increasingly being integrated into early-stage management, with adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR-mutated NSCLC and alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrating substantial survival benefits. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become a cornerstone of treatment for AGA-negative NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, and is increasingly being utilized in the perioperative setting. Furthermore, emerging therapies such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and novel immunotherapeutic agents show promise in addressing resistance mechanisms and improving outcomes in advanced-stage disease.

By promoting multivalent galectin-glycoprotein lattice formation at the cell surface, branching regulates clustering and/or endocytosis of the TCR complex (TCR+CD4/CD8), CD45, CD25, BCR, TLR2 and TLR4 to inhibit T cell and B cell activation/proliferation and proinflammatory TH1 and TH17 over TH2 and induced T regulatory cell responses. In addition, branching promotes cell surface retention of the growth inhibitory receptor CTLA-4. However, the role of N-glycan branching in regulating cell surface levels of other checkpoint receptors such as BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) is unknown. In this study, we report that whereas branching significantly enhances PD-1 cell surface expression by reducing loss from endocytosis, the opposite occurs with BTLA in both T cells and B cells. T cell hyperactivity induced by branching deficiency was opposed by BTLA ligation proportional to increased BTLA expression. Other members of the BTLA/HVEM (herpesvirus entry mediator) signaling axis in T cells, including HVEM, LIGHT, and CD160, are largely unaltered by branching. Thus, branching-mediated endocytosis of BTLA is opposite of branching-induced inhibition of PD-1 endocytosis. In this manner, branching deficiency-induced upregulation of BTLA appears to serve as a checkpoint to limit extreme T cell hyperactivity and proinflammatory outcomes in T cells with low branching.\nPMID: 38281324\nTitle: Blockade of BTLA alone or in combination with PD-1 restores the activation and proliferation of CD8\nAbstract: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection can result in typical peripheral blood lymphopenia and immune dysfunction.
